# RealTestFailures

The data includes a database image of the build results of 225,860 Travis builds run by 493 projects (some projects not studied in this paper are included). Build results include the build state, timestamps, and for builds whose logs we could parse the test identifiers of failed tests. Unparsed logs of all builds are also provided in text files.

## Note: 

The repository will be released along with the camera-ready copy of the paper to ensure we incorporate reviewer feedback.
